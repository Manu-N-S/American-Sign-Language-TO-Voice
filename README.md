# American-Sign-Language-TO-Voice
 Developing an ASL to voice converter using OpenCV & CNN. Capture ASL gestures using a camera, train a CNN model, and integrate into an app that uses text-to-speech. Testing & optimization to ensure accuracy & real-time performance. Helps bridge communication gap for the hearing-impaired.

# Project Description:<br/>
American Sign Language to Voice Converter using OpenCV and CNN
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and convert them into spoken language. This will be achieved using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithms.
The project will involve creating a dataset of ASL gestures using a camera, which will be used to train a CNN model. The camera will capture video of the user's hand movements as they perform ASL gestures, and this video data will be used to train the model to recognize the different gestures.
Once the model has been trained, it will be integrated into an application that can be used to convert ASL gestures to spoken language. The application will use the camera to capture video of the user's hand movements, and then the CNN model will analyze the video to determine which ASL gesture is being performed. The application will then use text-to-speech technology to convert the recognized gesture into spoken language.
To ensure the accuracy of the system, the project will involve extensive testing and fine-tuning of the CNN model. The project will also involve optimizing the performance of the application so that it can run in real-time and provide accurate results.
Overall, the American Sign Language to Voice Converter project will help bridge the communication gap between the hearing-impaired community and the rest of the population by providing a tool that can convert ASL gestures into spoken language.
